# Employee-Attrition-Prediction using Classification and ANN


# Problem Statement:

You work as a data scientist at this multinational corporation and the HR team has collected some data for you on their employees.

They will be asking you to predict which employees are more likely to quit.

So the HR team collected information about

1.Job Involvement - Are they involved in their jobs or not

2.About their education - Do they have a bachelor's degree and master's degree PHC for example.

3.Job Satisfaction - Are they satisfied for example or not with performance the

4.Relationship Satisfaction with their team and with their manager as well

5. Work Life Balance as well.

there are almost 35 factors/features the HR team actually provided us to predict the employee retention.

# Steps Involved in this Project:

we're going to perform Feature Engineering, EDA, Feature Importance, Splitting our dataset into train and test, Feature Scaling, Applying classification algorithms & DL model(ANN)
